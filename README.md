# DeviantScrap
## What can we do with it?
This software allows you to scrap all publications (Title, Tags, Description, Link of image and download image) from a publisher on DeviantArt. You just need to press the button to start the process.
The **default output** is in the **same folder** where DeviantScrap.exe is located.
This will create a **folder** with the **same name** of the nickname.

## How to use it ?
Fill in the nickname space with the **nickname you want to delete**.
If you don't use a specific tag, the software will take all tags under all posts.
**To add a tag** you must check the box below the text field where you enter the tag.

## Why use it?
I created this tool to practice and create different statistics on DeviantArt.

## Future objective :
Possibility of scraping **by username or by url.**
Consider the difference class to retrieve links on possible pages.
